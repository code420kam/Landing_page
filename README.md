## Instructions

The starter Project had some basic *HTML* and *CSS* to display a static version of the Landing Page project. My issue was to write a *JavaScript* part  
to make the Landing Page more dynamical.

### What I have'd changed

The first step was to create a dynamic navigation bar, the size of which depended on the number of sectors. In the next step I setted up the viewport and makes some new *CSS* rules for the section which is actually in the viewport. After this step I created for the navigation bar a scroll *function* which makes the scrolling to *smove*.
